      <Notes>1/A. Wild type Enterobacteriaceae are categorised as susceptible to aminopenicillins. 
Some countries prefer to categorise wild type isolates of E. coli and P. mirabilis as intermediate. When this is the case, use the MIC breakpoint S ≤ 0.5 mg/L and the corresponding zone diameter breakpoint S ≥ 50 mm.
2. For susceptibility testing purposes, the concentration of sulbactam is fixed at 4 mg/L.
3. For susceptibility testing purposes, the concentration of clavulanic acid is fixed at 2 mg/L. 
4. For susceptibility testing purposes, the concentration of tazobactam is fixed at 4 mg/L.


B. Ignore growth that may appear as a thin inner zone on some batches of Mueller-Hinton agars.
C. Susceptibility inferred from ampicillin.
D. Ignore isolated colonies within the inhibition zone for E. coli.</Notes>

      <Notes>1. The cephalosporin breakpoints for Enterobacteriaceae will detect all clinically important resistance mechanisms (including ESBL and plasmid mediated AmpC). Some isolates that produce beta-lactamases are susceptible or intermediate to 3rd or 4th generation cephalosporins with these breakpoints and should be reported as tested, i.e. the presence or absence of an ESBL does not in itself influence the categorisation of susceptibility. ESBL detection and characterisation are recommended for public health and infection control purposes.
2. The cefoxitin ECOFF (8 mg/L) has a high sensitivity but poor specificity for identification of AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae as this agent is also affected by permeability alterations and some carbapenemases. Classical non-AmpC producers are wild type, whereas plasmid AmpC producers or chromosomal AmpC hyperproducers are non-wild type.
3. For susceptibility testing purposes, the concentration of tazobactam is fixed at 4 mg/L.
4. Breakpoints are based on high dose therapy (1.5 g x 3). </Notes>

      <Notes>1. There is clinical evidence for ciprofloxacin to indicate a poor response in systemic infections caused by Salmonella spp. with low-level ciprofloxacin resistance (MIC &gt;0.06 mg/L). The available data relate mainly to  Salmonella Typhi but there are also case reports of poor response with other Salmonella species. 

A. Tests with a ciprofloxacin 5 µg disk will not reliably detect low-level resistance in Salmonella spp. To screen for ciprofloxacin resistance in Salmonella spp., use the pefloxacin 5 µg disk. See Note B. 
B. Susceptibility of Salmonella spp. to ciprofloxacin can be inferred from pefloxacin disk diffusion susceptibility.</Notes>

      <Notes>1/A. Most staphylococci are penicillinase producers, which are resistant to benzylpenicillin, phenoxymethylpenicillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, piperacillin and ticarcillin. Isolates negative for penicillinase and susceptible to methicillin can be reported susceptible to these agents. Isolates positive for penicillinase and methicillin susceptible are susceptible to beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations and isoxazolylpenicillins (oxacillin, cloxacillin, dicloxacillin and flucloxacillin).
Methicillin resistant isolates are, with few exceptions, resistant to all beta-lactam agents. 
2/C. No currently available method can reliably detect penicillinase production in coagulase-negative staphylococci.
3/D. Ampicillin susceptible S. saprophyticus are mecA-negative and susceptible to ampicillin, amoxicillin and piperacillin (without or with a beta-lactamase inhibitor).
4. S. aureus, S. lugdunensis and S. saprophyticus with oxacillin MIC values &gt;2 mg/L are mostly methicillin resistant due to the presence of the mecA or mecC gene. The corresponding oxacillin MIC for coagulase-negative staphylococci other than S. saprophyticus and S. lugdunensis is &gt;0.25 mg/L.

B. For S. aureus, disk diffusion is more reliable than MIC determination for detection of penicillinase producers, provided the zone diameter is measured AND the zone edge closely inspected (see pictures below). If the zone diameter is &lt;26 mm, then report resistant. If the zone diameter is ≥26 mm AND the zone edge is sharp, then report resistant. If not sharp, then report susceptible and if uncertain, then report resistant. Chromogenic cephalosporin-based beta-lactamase tests do not reliably detect staphylococcal penicillinase.</Notes>

Susceptibility of staphylococci to cephalosporins is inferred from the cefoxitin susceptibility except for cefixime, ceftazidime, ceftibuten and ceftolozane-tazobactam, which do not have breakpoints and should not be used for staphylococcal infections. Some methicillin-resistant S. aureus are susceptible to ceftaroline and ceftobiprole, see Notes 5/B and 6/C.
2. Breakpoints are based on high dose therapy (500 mg x 2).
3. S. aureus and S. lugdunensis with cefoxitin MIC values &gt;4 mg/L and S. saprophyticus with cefoxitin MIC values &gt;8 mg/L are methicillin resistant, mostly due to the presence of the mecA or mecC gene. Disk diffusion reliably predicts methicillin resistance.
4. For staphylococci other than S. aureus, S. lugdunensis and S. saprophyticus, the cefoxitin MIC is a poorer predictor of methicillin resistance than the disk diffusion test. 
5/B. Methicillin-susceptible isolates can be reported susceptible to ceftaroline without further testing.
6/C. Methicillin-susceptible isolates can be reported susceptible to ceftobiprole without further testing.

      <Notes>1. Glycopeptide MICs are method dependent and should be determined by broth microdilution (reference ISO 20776). S. aureus with vancomycin MIC values of 2 mg/L are on the border of the wild type distribution and there may be an impaired clinical response. The resistant breakpoint has been reduced to 2 mg/L to avoid reporting &quot;GISA&quot; isolates intermediate as serious infections with &quot;GISA&quot; isolates are not treatable with increased doses of vancomycin or teicoplanin.
2. Non-susceptible isolates are rare or not yet reported. The identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test result on any such isolate must be confirmed and the isolate sent to a reference laboratory.
3. MICs must be determined in the presence of polysorbate-80 (0.002% in the medium for broth dilution methods; agar dilution methods have not been validated). Follow the manufacturers&apos; instructions for commercial systems.
4. S. aureus isolates susceptible to vancomycin can be reported susceptible to dalbavancin and oritavancin.
5. MRSA isolates susceptible to vancomycin can be reported susceptible to telavancin.
 
A. Disk diffusion is unreliable and cannot distinguish between wild type isolates and those with non-vanA-mediated glycopeptide resistance. </Notes>

        <Note id="1">Glycopeptide MICs are method dependent and should be determined by broth microdilution (reference ISO 20776). S. aureus with vancomycin MIC values of 2 mg/L are on the border of the wild type distribution and there may be an impaired clinical response. The resistant breakpoint has been reduced to 2 mg/L to avoid reporting &quot;GISA&quot; isolates intermediate as serious infections with &quot;GISA&quot; isolates are not treatable with increased doses of vancomycin or teicoplanin.</Note>

      <Notes>1/A. Erythromycin can be used to determine susceptibility to azithromycin, clarithromycin and roxithromycin.
2. Inducible clindamycin resistance can be detected by antagonism of clindamycin activity by a macrolide agent. If not detected, then report as susceptible. If detected, then report as resistant and consider adding this comment to the report: &quot;Clindamycin may still be used for short-term therapy of less serious skin and soft tissue infections as constitutive resistance is unlikely to develop during such therapy&quot;.

B. Place the erythromycin and clindamycin disks 12-20 mm apart (edge to edge) and look for antagonism (the D phenomenon) to detect inducible clindamycin resistance.
C. Isolates non-susceptible by disk diffusion should be confirmed by MIC testing.</Notes>

An MIC method should be used to test doxycycline susceptibility of tetracycline resistant isolates if required.
2. Non-susceptible isolates are rare or not yet reported. The identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test result on any such isolate must be confirmed and the isolate sent to a reference laboratory.
3. For tigecycline broth microdilution MIC determination, the medium must be prepared fresh on the day of use.

2. Daptomycin MICs must be determined in the presence of Ca2+ (50 mg/L in the medium for broth dilution methods; agar dilution methods have not been validated). Follow the manufacturers&apos; instructions for commercial systems.
3. Fosfomycin MICs must be determined in the presence of glucose-6-phosphate (25 mg/L in the medium for broth and agar dilution methods). Follow the manufacturers&apos; instructions for commercial systems.
4/B. Breakpoints relate to nasal decolonisation of S. aureus. Intermediate isolates are associated with short term suppression (useful preoperatively) but, unlike susceptible isolates, long term eradication rates are low.

5. Trimethoprim:sulfamethoxazole in the ratio 1:19. Breakpoints are expressed as the trimethoprim concentration.

A. Use an MIC method.

      <Notes>1. Enterococci are intrinsically resistant to aminoglycosides and aminoglycoside monotherapy is ineffective. There is likely to be synergy between aminoglycosides and penicillins or glycopeptides against enterococci without acquired high-level resistance. All testing is therefore to distinguish between intrinsic and high-level acquired resistance.
2/A. Gentamicin can be used to screen for high-level aminoglycoside resistance (HLAR). 
Negative test: Isolates with gentamicin MIC ≤128 mg/L or a zone diameter ≥8 mm. The isolate is wild type for gentamicin and low-level intrinsic resistant. For other aminoglycosides, this may not be the case. Synergy with penicillins or glycopeptides can be expected if the isolate is susceptible to the penicillin or glycopeptide. 
Positive test: Isolates with gentamicin MIC &gt;128 mg/L or a zone diameter &lt;8 mm. The isolate is high-level resistant to gentamicin and other aminoglycosides, except streptomycin which must be tested separately if required (see note 3/B). There will be no synergy with penicillins or glycopeptides.
3/B. Isolates with high-level gentamicin resistance may not be high-level resistant to streptomycin. 
Negative test: Isolates with streptomycin MIC ≤512 mg/L or a zone diameter ≥14 mm. The isolate is wild type for streptomycin and low-level intrinsic resistant. Synergy with penicillins or glycopeptides can be expected if the isolate is susceptible to the penicillin or glycopeptide.
Positive test: Isolates with streptomycin MIC &gt;512 mg/L or a zone diameter &lt;14 mm. The isolate is high-level resistant to streptomycin. There will be no synergy with penicillins or glycopeptides.</Notes>

      <Notes>1. Non-susceptible isolates are rare or not yet reported. The identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test result on any such isolate must be confirmed and the isolate sent to a reference laboratory.
2. MICs must be determined in the presence of polysorbate-80 (0.002% in the medium for broth dilution methods; agar dilution methods have not been validated). Follow the manufacturers&apos; instructions for commercial systems.
3. Isolates susceptible to vancomycin can be reported susceptible to dalbavancin and oritavancin.

A. Disk diffusion criteria have not been defined and an MIC method should be used.
 Zone diameter breakpoints are based on wild type distributions as there are currently no resistant isolates. </Notes>

      <Notes>1/A. Erythromycin can be used to determine susceptibility to azithromycin, clarithromycin and roxithromycin.
2. Inducible clindamycin resistance can be detected by antagonism of clindamycin activity by a macrolide agent. If not detected, then report as susceptible. If detected, then report as resistant and consider adding this comment to the report: &quot;Clindamycin may still be used for short-term therapy of less serious skin and soft tissue infections as constitutive resistance is unlikely to develop during such therapy&quot;. The clinical importance of inducible clindamycin resistance in combination treatment of severe S. pyogenes infections is not known.

B. Place the erythromycin and clindamycin disks 12-16 mm apart (edge to edge) and look for antagonism (the D phenomenon) to detect inducible clindamycin resistance.</Notes>

      <Notes>1. Breakpoints for penicillins other than benzylpenicillin relate only to non-meningitis isolates. 
Isolates fully susceptible to benzylpenicillin (MIC ≤0.06 mg/L and/or susceptible by oxacillin disk screen, see note C) can be reported susceptible to beta-lactam agents for which clinical breakpoints are listed (including those with &quot;Note&quot;).
2. In pneumonia, when a dose of 1.2 g x 4 is used, isolates with MIC ≤0.5 mg/L should be regarded as susceptible.
In pneumonia, when a dose of 2.4 g x 4 or 1.2 g x 6 is used, isolates with MIC ≤1 mg/L should be regarded as susceptible.
In pneumonia, when a dose of 2.4 g x 6 is used, isolates with MIC ≤2 mg/L should be regarded as susceptible.
3. For isolates categorised as intermediate to ampicillin avoid oral treatment with ampicillin, amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid.
4/B. Susceptibility inferred from the MIC of ampicillin.

A. Screen for beta-lactam resistance with the oxacillin 1 μg disk, see Note C. 
C. For interpretation of the oxacillin disk screen, see supplementary table below.
For oxacillin non-susceptible isolates, always determine the MIC of benzylpenicillin. </Notes>

2. Inducible clindamycin resistance can be detected by antagonism of clindamycin activity by a macrolide agent. If not detected, then report as susceptible. If detected, then report as resistant.

B. Place the erythromycin and clindamycin disks 12-16 mm apart (edge to edge) and look for antagonism (the D phenomenon) to detect inducible clindamycin resistance.</Notes>

A. Benzylpenicillin 1 unit can be used to screen for beta-lactam resistance in viridans group streptococci. Isolates categorised as susceptible can be reported susceptible to beta-lactam agents for which clinical breakpoints are listed (including those with “Note”). Isolates categorised as non-susceptible should be tested for susceptibility to individual agents.</Notes>

      <Notes>1. Viridans group streptococci are intrinsically resistant to aminoglycosides and aminoglycoside monotherapy is ineffective. There is likely to be synergy between aminoglycosides and penicillins or glycopeptides against streptococci without acquired high-level resistance. All testing is therefore to distinguish between intrinsic and high-level acquired resistance.
2. Gentamicin can be used to screen for high-level aminoglycoside resistance (HLAR).
Negative test: Isolates with gentamicin MIC ≤128 mg/L. The isolate is wild type for gentamicin and low-level intrinsic resistant. For other aminoglycosides, this may not be the case. Synergy with penicillins or glycopeptides can be expected if the isolate is susceptible to the penicillin or glycopeptide. 
Positive test: Isolates with gentamicin MIC &gt;128 mg/L. The isolate is high-level resistant to gentamicin and other aminoglycosides except streptomycin. There will be no synergy with penicillins or glycopeptides.</Notes>

      <Notes>1. Non-susceptible isolates are rare or not yet reported. The identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test result on any such isolate must be confirmed and the isolate sent to a reference laboratory.
2. MICs must be determined in the presence of polysorbate-80 (0.002% in the medium for broth dilution methods; agar dilution methods have not been validated).  Follow the manufacturers&apos; instructions for commercial systems.
3. Isolates susceptible to vancomycin can be reported susceptible to dalbavancin and oritavancin.

A. Disk diffusion criteria have not been defined and an MIC method should be used.
Zone diameter breakpoints are based on wild type distributions as there are currently no resistant isolates. </Notes>

      <Notes>1. Breakpoints are based on intravenous administration. For penicillins without inhibitors, breakpoints apply to beta-lactamase negative isolates only. For penicillins without inhibitors, beta-lactamase positive isolates should be reported resistant.
2. For susceptibility testing purposes, the concentration of sulbactam is fixed at 4 mg/L.
3/B. Susceptibility can be inferred from amoxicillin-clavulanic acid.
4. For susceptibility testing purposes, the concentration of clavulanic acid is fixed at 2 mg/L.
5/D. Susceptibility inferred from ampicillin or amoxicillin.

A. Benzylpenicillin 1 unit can be used to screen for, but not to distinguish between, beta-lactamase producing isolates and isolates with PBP mutations. For interpretation of the benzylpenicillin disk screen, see supplementary table below.
C. Susceptibility can be inferred from ampicillin.</Notes>

A. The nalidixic acid disk diffusion test can be used to screen for fluoroquinolone resistance. See Note B.
B. Isolates categorised as susceptible to nalidixic acid can be reported susceptible to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin and ofloxacin. Isolates categorised as non-susceptible may have fluoroquinolone resistance and should be tested against the appropriate agent. </Notes>

  <Family name="Gram-positive anaerobes except Clostridium difficile" defined="false">
    <Advice>This group of bacteria includes many genera. The most frequently isolated Gram-positive anaerobes are: Clostridium, Actinomyces, Propionibacterium, Bifidobacterium, Eggerthella, Eubacterium, Lactobacillus and anaerobic gram-positive cocci. Anaerobes are most frequently defined by no growth on culture plates incubated in a CO2 enriched atmosphere, but many Gram-positive, non-spore forming rods such as Actinomyces spp., many P. acnes and some Bifidobacterium spp. can grow on incubation in CO2 and may be tolerant enough to grow poorly in air, but are still considered as anaerobic bacteria. Several species of Clostridium, including C. carnis, C. histolyticum and C. tertium, can grow but not sporulate in air.  For all these species, susceptibility testing should be performed in anaerobic environment.</Advice>
    <Group name="Penicillins">
      <Notes>1. Susceptibility to ampicillin, amoxicillin, piperacillin and ticarcillin can be inferred from susceptibility to benzylpenicillin.
2. For susceptibility testing purposes, the concentration of sulbactam is fixed at 4 mg/L.
3. For susceptibility testing purposes, the concentration of clavulanic acid is fixed at 2 mg/L. 
4. For susceptibility testing purposes, the concentration of tazobactam is fixed at 4 mg/L.

    <Advice>This group of bacteria includes many genera.  The most frequently isolated Gram-negative anaerobes are Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Bilophila and Mobiluncus. Anaerobes are most frequently defined by no growth on culture plates incubated in a CO2 enriched atmosphere. For all these species, susceptibility testing should be performed in anaerobic environment.</Advice>
